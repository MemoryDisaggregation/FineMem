All source codes of LegoHeap and FuDM are avaliable here, while we are still working on complete the documents. And the source code of LegoAlloc-User, LegoAlloc-Swap and LegoAlloc-KV stores at other repos, which we will add in this repo future.

Only OFED & Cmake needed, no other libraray requirement.
